          Paris, city and capital of France, situated in the north-central part
          of the country. People were living on the site of the present-day
          city, located along the Seine River some 233 miles (375 km) upstream
          from the river’s mouth on the English Channel (La Manche), by about
          7600 BCE. The modern city has spread from the island (the Île de la
          Cité) and far beyond both banks of the Seine. Paris occupies a central
          position in the rich agricultural region known as the Paris Basin, and
          it constitutes one of eight départements of the Île-de-France
          administrative region. It is by far the country’s most important
          centre of commerce and culture. Area city, 41 square miles (105 square
          km); metropolitan area, 890 square miles (2,300 square km). Pop.
          (2012) city, 2,265,886; (2015 est.) urban agglomeration, 10,858,000.

          Paris is positioned at the centre of the Île-de-France region, which
          is crossed by the Seine, Oise, and Marne rivers. The city is ringed
          with great forests of beech and oak; they are called the “lungs of
          Paris,” for they help to purify the air in the heavily industrialized
          region. The city proper is small; no corner is farther than about 6
          miles (10 km) from the square in front of Notre-Dame Cathedral. It
          occupies a depression hollowed out by the Seine, and the surrounding
          heights have been respected as the limits of the city. Elevation
          varies from 430 feet (130 metres) at the butte of Montmartre, in the
          north, to 85 feet (26 metres) in the Grenelle area, in the southwest.
          The Seine flows for about 8 miles (13 km) through the centre of the
          city and 10 of the 20 arrondissements.
