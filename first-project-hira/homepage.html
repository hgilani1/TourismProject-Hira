            Paris, city and capital of France, situated in the north-central
            part of the country. People were living on the site of the
            present-day city, located along the Seine River some 233 miles (375
            km) upstream from the river’s mouth on the English Channel (La
            Manche), by about 7600 BCE. The modern city has spread from the
            island (the Île de la Cité) and far beyond both banks of the Seine.
            Paris occupies a central position in the rich agricultural region
            known as the Paris Basin, and it constitutes one of eight
            départements of the Île-de-France administrative region. It is by
            far the country’s most important centre of commerce and culture.
            Area city, 41 square miles (105 square km); metropolitan area, 890
            square miles (2,300 square km). Pop. (2012) city, 2,265,886; (2015
            est.) urban agglomeration, 10,858,000.

            For centuries Paris has been one of the world’s most important and
            attractive cities. It is appreciated for the opportunities it offers
            for business and commerce, for study, for culture, and for
            entertainment; its gastronomy, haute couture, painting, literature,
            and intellectual community especially enjoy an enviable reputation.
            Its sobriquet “the City of Light” (“la Ville Lumière”), earned
            during the Enlightenment, remains appropriate, for Paris has
            retained its importance as a centre for education and intellectual
            pursuits. Paris’s site at a crossroads of both water and land routes
            significant not only to France but also to Europe has had a
            continuing influence on its growth. Under Roman administration, in
            the 1st century BCE, the original site on the Île de la Cité was
            designated the capital of the Parisii tribe and territory.

              Paris is positioned at the centre of the Île-de-France region,
              which is crossed by the Seine, Oise, and Marne rivers. The city is
              ringed with great forests of beech and oak; they are called the
              “lungs of Paris,” for they help to purify the air in the heavily
              industrialized region. The city proper is small; no corner is
              farther than about 6 miles (10 km) from the square in front of
              Notre-Dame Cathedral. It occupies a depression hollowed out by the
              Seine, and the surrounding heights have been respected as the
              limits of the city. Elevation varies from 430 feet (130 metres) at
              the butte of Montmartre, in the north, to 85 feet (26 metres) in
              the Grenelle area, in the southwest. The Seine flows for about 8
              miles (13 km) through the centre of the city and 10 of the 20
              arrondissements. It enters the city at the southeast corner, flows
              northwestward, and turns gradually southwestward, eventually
              leaving Paris at the southwest corner. As a result, what starts
              out as the stream’s east bank becomes its north bank and ends as
              the west bank, and the Parisians therefore adopted the simple,
              unchanging designation of Right Bank and Left Bank (when facing
              downstream). Specific places, however, are usually indicated by
              arrondissement or by quarter (quartier).
