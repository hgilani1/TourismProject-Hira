# TourismProject-Hira

This repository contains the html and scss files for my tourism project.

First, i had completed all the html files by adding the contents that i wanted to include on each page.

Then,i created Scss files (and ensured theses were watched and converted into css files) and i went on to designing the navigation bar of the home page. Once that was completed, i had created a mixin, that could be used on all other pages.

From there, i went on to designing and formatting the home page. This helped me create a clear base and structure of how i wanted the rest of my website to look.

Once this was completed, i went onto designing and formatting the other pages; explore, gallery, getting there and contact.

The final stage was adding in media queries to all pages and ensuring the pages were formatted correctly, to be viewed on phone, tablet, tablet landscape and laptop.
